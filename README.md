# Online-Gas-Booking-System
made for school, uses python, mysql and mysql.connector(it was the only one we could use)
i plan on porting it to tkinter or something

How to use:
1. Install mysql.connector by this command 'pip install mysql-connector-python'
2. Use the schema.sql(ask chatgpt or whatever on how to install it) to make the database and tables (its empty)
3. Add an admin user in the Users table
4. Use the program
